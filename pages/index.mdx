# WPCodeBox 2 Documentation

Welcome to the official documentation for WPCodeBox! This guide will help you get started with WPCodeBox and show you how to use its advanced code editing features to manage your code snippets on your WordPress site.

## Why I Released WPCodeBox 2 as a Separate Plugin

WPCodeBox 2.0 is a major update to the WPCodeBox plugin that includes a lot of new features and improvements. Due to the significant changes that were made in this update, preserving backward compatibility with older versions of the plugin would have been difficult.

To avoid the risk of breaking existing sites, I decided to release WPCodeBox 2.0 as a separate plugin. This allows users to upgrade to the new version on their own terms, and ensures that the transition is smooth and painless.

While I understand that this may be an inconvenience for some users, I believe that it is the best approach for ensuring the stability and reliability of WPCodeBox. I hope that you will enjoy the new features and improvements that WPCodeBox 2.0 has to offer, and I look forward to your feedback and suggestions as I continue to improve and refine the plugin.
