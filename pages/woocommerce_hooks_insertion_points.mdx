How to run your code on a specific WooCommerce hook or action
===============================================================

WPCodeBox makes it easy to run code when WooCommerce is active on specific actions or hooks.

For example, if you want to run a code snippet after the summary on the single product page, you just need to select that under "Where to insert the snippet" when creating the snippet:
