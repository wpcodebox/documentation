# How to Add PHP Code Snippets to Your WordPress Site with WPCodeBox

WPCodeBox makes adding PHP code snippets to your WordPress site a breeze! With just a few simple steps, you can create and manage custom PHP code snippets effortlessly. Follow this guide to get started:

## Creating a New PHP Snippet

1. Click on the "New Snippet" button located in the left pane of WPCodeBox. This will open up a new snippet creation window.

2. Fill out the required fields:
    - **Title**: Give your snippet a descriptive title to easily identify its purpose.
    - **Description**: Provide a brief description of what the snippet does or its intended use.
    - **How to Run**: Select the appropriate option to specify how the snippet should be executed (e.g., on 'init', 'wp_footer', etc.).

3. You'll find an interactive text editor that supports various languages, including PHP, JavaScript, and HTML. Since the default Code Type is PHP, you don't need to make any changes to indicate PHP code.

4. Start pasting your PHP code into the text editor, ensuring to include the opening PHP tag `<?php`.

## Saving and Managing Snippets

1. To save your changes, simply click the "Save" button above the text editor or use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl + S (Command + S on Mac).

2. By default, when you save a snippet, it will be disabled to prevent potential errors on your site. This allows you to review and test the code before enabling it to run.

3. Once you are satisfied with your code and have tested it thoroughly, you can enable the snippet to make it functional on your WordPress site.
