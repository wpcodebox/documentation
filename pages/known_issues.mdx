# Known issues in WPCodeBox 2 v1.0.3

### Cannot update hook priority when writing PHP Snippets

A JS error is thrown when trying to update the hook priority when writing PHP snippets. When trying
to update the hook priority, the number doesn't change.
This is a known issue and will be fixed in the next release.

### Error triggered if you have XML code in a php snippet, like this

```php
<?php

// This is a PHP snippet with XML code
$xml = '<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" ?>';

```

Solution: 

To fix the error, at this at the end of your snippet:

// {'<?php'}

Your snippet would look like this:
```php
<?php

// This is a PHP snippet with XML code
$xml = '<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" ?>;

// <?php
```

### Blank screen when enabling the functionality plugin and removing WPCodeBox 2

If you enable the functionality plugin and then remove WPCodeBox 2, you will get a blank screen. This is caused by the autoreload code
from withing the FP, a fix is available in the next release

### Error in the logs when activating WPCodeBox 2 for the first time

When you activate WPCodeBox 2 for the first time, you might see this error in your logs:
```
WordPress database error Server shutdown in progress for query SELECT * FROM wp_wpcb_snippets WHERE id = 1 made by require('wp-blog-header.php'), require_once('wp-load.php'), require_once('wp-config.php'), require_once('wp-settings.php'), include_once('/plugins/wpcodebox2/wpcodebox2.php'), Wpcb2\Service\WPCodeBox2->executeSnippets, Wpcb2\Runner\QueryRunner->runQueries, eval, Wpcb2\ConditionBuilder\ShouldExecute::should_execute, Wpcb2\ConditionBuilder\ShouldExecute->shouldExecute, Wpcb2\Repository\SnippetRepository->getSnippet"
```

This happens because WPCodeBox 2 is trying to execute the snippets before the custom tables are created. It doesn't impede in anyway the functionality of the plugin.

I am looking for a fix that would not require extra DB queries on each request to handle this edge case.

### Minification of CSS snippets might remove quotes in some cases

With the more exotic CSS properties, minification might remove quotes in some cases. If this happens, you can add the respective properties to an unminified CSS file.

### You cannot include a SCSS partial in another SCSS partial

This is a known limitation of the SCSS compiler. You cannot include _partial2 in _partial2. You would need to include both _partial1 and _partial2 in the SCSS file where you want to use the variables from _partial2.
