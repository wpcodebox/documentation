### Code Signing and Signatures in the WPCodeBox Functionality Plugin

When using the WPCodeBox Functionality Plugin, code signing ensures the integrity of your snippets. Here's how it works:

-   **Signatures File (`signatures.php`):** The Functionality Plugin generates a `signatures.php` file containing a hash (signature) for each snippet. This hash is based on the snippet's code, providing a unique identifier that reflects the snippet's content.
-   **Integrity Verification:** WPCodeBox checks the signatures in the `signatures.php` file against the actual code snippets in the database. If a discrepancy is found (e.g., a snippet is modified directly in the database), WPCodeBox will notify you about the change.
-   **Protection Against Unauthorized Changes:** This mechanism ensures that any changes made outside WPCodeBox (such as direct database edits) are detected, helping to secure your site's custom functionality.

The signatures help maintain trust and stability, alerting you to any potential issues with your code snippets.
