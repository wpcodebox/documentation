# How to display an ACF Field using a shortcode

This is a simple example of how to display an ACF field using a shortcode.
You will need to create a PHP Snippet and set it to run as a shortcode:


<Image src="/images/acf_field_shortcode.png" width={800} height={800} style={{marginTop: 15}} />


This will allow you to use the shortcode in your content editor like this:
`[my_custom_shortcode]`

The shortcode will then display the ACF field value on the front end.
