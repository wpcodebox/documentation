# Running Snippets using an External Secure URL

With WPCodeBox, you can run your snippets using an external secure URL. This is useful if you want to trigger a specific action on your website, or if you want to run a snippet from an external service like Zapier.

## How to Run the Snippet using an External Secure URL

1\. Go to the WPCodeBox Snippet Editor.

2\. Select "Using an external secure URL" for the "How to run the snippet" option.

3\. A secure URL will be generated. Copy it to the clipboard.

4\. You can now use this URL to run the snippet.

## Regenerating the External Secure URL

If you want to regenerate the external secure URL, simply click the "Regenerate" button. This will make the old URL invalid and generate a new one.

## Examples of Using External Secure URL

Here are some examples of how you can use the external secure URL feature:

- Trigger a specific action on your website when a certain event happens, like a new email subscription or a form submission.

- Run a snippet from an external service like Zapier.

- Use the URL in a webhook to execute the snippet when a certain event happens.
