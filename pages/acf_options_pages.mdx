# Register an ACF Options Page using WPCodeBox

To register an ACF Options Page, you need to create a new snippet, and leave all its settings to the default values.

Then, you need to add the following code to the snippet:

```php copy
<?php

if( function_exists('acf_add_options_page') ) {

    acf_add_options_page();

}
```

Then, you need to save the snippet and enable it, and you will see the ACF Options Page in the WordPress admin menu.
