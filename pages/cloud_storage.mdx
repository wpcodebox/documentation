How do I have access to my cloud account?
-----------------------------------------

WPCodeBox can access the cloud account using an API Key. When you download WPCodeBox, your API Key will be included in the plugin, so you don't have to do anything.

You can regenerate the API Key in your account. When doing this, you will have to change the API Key in settings everywhere where you installed WPCodeBox.

Uploading code snippets to the cloud
------------------------------------

To upload code snippets to the cloud, you can click the "Upload to cloud button". That button is available once you save the snippet. If you want to make changes to a cloud snippet, you just modify it locally, and then click "Upload to cloud again". Snippets that are saved to the cloud, will have a cloud icon next to them in the snippet list.

Downloading code snippets from the cloud
----------------------------------------

You will see the cloud snippets listed on the bottom left-hand side in the snippet list. To download a snippet from the cloud, just hover the snippet you want to download, and the "Download from cloud" icon will appear next to the snippet. Once you download the snippet from the cloud, you just need to enable it. Snippets that are downloaded from the cloud are disabled by default.


### Cloud Folders
Since version 1.2.0, WPCodeBox allows you to create and upload/download folders from the cloud.

This feature allows you to better organize your WordPress cloud snippets.

#### How it works
Local and cloud folder management is independent. So, if you have a folder locally, and remove a snippet from it, or move a snippet to another folder, when uploading the folder to the cloud these changes won’t be updated. Only the changes that are currently in that folder will be updated in the cloud.

This way you can manage folders independently locally and in the cloud. When downloading a folder from the cloud, only the snippets that are in that folder will be updated locally. Changes like moving a snippet from one folder to another locally won’t get updated to the cloud as that could cause confusion.

#### Why use Cloud Folders
This feature allows you to organize your WordPress snippets as you want, locally or in the cloud.

When installing WPCodeBox on a new site, this allows you to pull all your Code Snippets with just one click, saving you time by not needing to download them one by one.

WordPress code snippets can still be uploaded and downloaded from the cloud one by one as needed.
