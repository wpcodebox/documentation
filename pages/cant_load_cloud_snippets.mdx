# What to do if your cloud snippets don't load

## Check you have the correct API Key in the settings

You can find your master API Key in your WPCodeBox dashboard, or you can create additional API Keys
using the API Key Manager (Beta).

If you created your API Key using the API Key Manager, make sure you have the correct permissions set and that it's enabled.

## If you use a VPN, try refreshing your IP

If you use a VPN, try refreshing your IP address. Some VPNs use shared IP addresses, and if that IP was used for suspicious
activity, your IP may be blocked. You can refresh your IP by disconnecting and reconnecting to your VPN.

## Check for plugin conflicts

A plugin conflict may prevent your cloud snippets from loading. Try disabling all other plugins and see if your cloud snippets load.
