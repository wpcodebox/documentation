How to add external CSS code to your WordPress site
===============================================================

WPCodeBox makes it easy to add external CSS code to your site. This is useful when you want to include 3rd party libraries from external CDNs. 

To enqueue external CSS code, we are going to select "CSS (External File)" as the type when creating a snippet.

Then, you can input the URL to your external CSS file under "External CSS File URL":

<Image src="/images/css_external_file.png" width={400} height={200} style={{marginTop: 15}} />

You can set it to run on the page where you need the external CSS code to be included.
