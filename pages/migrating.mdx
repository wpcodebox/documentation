# Upgrading to WPCodeBox 2.0: What You Need to Know

If you've been using WPCodeBox to manage code snippets on your WordPress site, you might have noticed that a major update has been released. WPCodeBox 2.0 is now available, and it brings with it a host of new features and improvements. However, upgrading to the new version requires some manual work. Here's what you need to know to make the transition smoothly.

## Installation and Activation

First things first: WPCodeBox 2.0 is a separate plugin from the original WPCodeBox. This means that you'll need to install the new plugin separately, and it won't automatically replace the old one. You can download WPCodeBox 2.0 from the WordPress plugin repository or from the WPCodeBox website.

Once you've installed WPCodeBox 2.0, you'll need to migrate your code snippets from the old plugin to the new one. Unfortunately, this can't be done automatically, as the two plugins have different database structures. You'll need to manually copy your snippets from the old plugin to the new one.

## Migration Steps

To do this, follow these steps:

1\. Make sure you have a backup of your WordPress site, just in case something goes wrong during the migration.

2\. Deactivate the old WPCodeBox plugin.

3\. Activate the new WPCodeBox 2.0 plugin.

4\. In the WPCodeBox 2.0 settings menu, click on the "Import" tab.

5\. Select the "WPCodeBox 1.x" option and click the "Import" button.

6\. Wait for the import process to finish. This may take some time if you have a lot of snippets.

7\. Once the import is complete, verify that all of your snippets have been migrated correctly.

8\. If everything looks good, you can safely delete the old WPCodeBox plugin.

It's worth noting that some features of WPCodeBox may have changed in the new version. Take some time to explore the new settings and options to make sure you're taking full advantage of what WPCodeBox 2.0 has to offer.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, upgrading to WPCodeBox 2.0 is a manual process, but it's well worth the effort. The new version brings significant improvements and features, and once you've migrated your snippets, you'll be able to enjoy a more powerful and streamlined code management experience on your WordPress site.
