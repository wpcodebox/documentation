### Define a Snippet in Quick Actions

Quick Actions are snippets that can be run easily and with a one click directly from your WordPress admin top bar. This helps when you want to speed up repetitive actions.

To make a snippet work as a quick action, do the following:

- Create a snippet or edit an existing snippet
- Change "How to run the snippet" to "Manual (On Demand)"
- Then, enable "Add to quick actions"

That's it! Once enabled, a "WPCodeBox Quick Actions" menu will appear with the snippet available to run it quickly and with just a click.
